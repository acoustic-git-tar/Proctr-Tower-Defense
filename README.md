Hello TAs.

DCD and SOLID/GRASP write-up deliverables are submitted in the assignment on Canvas.

Video demonstration is linked [here](https://youtu.be/2DleGEMpfJM). We would like to opt out of the video demo competition.

JUnit tests are in Proctr/src/test. The writeups are in Proctr/TESTWRITEUPM6.md.

Extra Credit is included in the Proctr/M6 Extra Credit.pdf.
